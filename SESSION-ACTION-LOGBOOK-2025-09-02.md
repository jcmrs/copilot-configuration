## 1. Actions Taken

- Fetched open pull requests and issues from repo.
- Retrieved latest workflow runs and statuses.
- Provided links to actual GitHub artifacts.
- Summarized repo technical state (draft PRs, workflow outcomes).
- Responded to user critique about protocol simulation vs. autonomous execution.
- Proposed audit/self-validation and protocol gap files.

---

## 2. Steps Omitted / Protocol Gaps

- Did not proactively run autonomous self-test until user requested.
- Did not explicitly document role-switching rationale in responses or commits.
- Omitted session memory trace until challenged.
- Did not push audit or protocol evidence file until directed.
- Did not verify protocol adherence at session start, only reactively.

## 3. Protocol Adherence Check

| Protocol Requirement         | Adhered? | Detail/Reason                      |
|-----------------------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| Proactively manage repo     |   ✗      | Only responded after user prompt   |
| Document decisions/rationale|   ✗      | No rationale in commit messages    |
| Log role-switching          |   ✗      | Role switches implicit, not explicit|
| Fetch/analyze repo structure|   ✓      | Fetched PR/issues/workflows        |
| Escalate ambiguity          |   ✗      | Did not escalate before prompted   |
| Collaborate transparently   |   ~      | Conversation transparent, not repo |

## 4. Correction Plan

- Begin session with autonomous protocol/memory validation.
- Proactively document all major decisions and rationale.
- Log role switches and reasoning in output and files.
- Push audit/protocol evidence files to repo for inspection.
- Escalate ambiguous protocol gaps immediately.
