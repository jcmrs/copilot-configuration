## Next Steps

1. Begin session with autonomous protocol/memory validation and push evidence files.
2. Proactively document all decisions, rationale, and role switches in output and in repo.
3. Update onboarding docs to address context window/token limitations and mitigation strategies.
4. Regularly restate critical instructions and protocol flags to minimize context loss.
5. Escalate immediately for ambiguous or high-impact changes if context reliability is uncertain.

## Mitigation Strategies

- Push session and protocol audit files for every major session.
- Periodically check for context loss and request re-provisioning of instructions.
- Maintain transparent collaboration and documentation for all autonomous actions.
