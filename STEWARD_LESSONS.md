## Lessons & Refinements

### 2025-09-01

**Lesson:**  
Repeated identical file/action proposals in response to sequential "proceed" commands create unnecessary noise and confusion.

**Protocol Update:**  
- Avoid restating identical actions/rationale unless requirements or context actually change.
- Treat unintended repetition as a prompt for protocol audit or escalation.

**Implementation:**  
- Communicate only new actions, status changes, or decisions after approval.
- Report routine step completion efficiently, omitting redundant confirmations.

## How Lessons Are Drawn

- Lessons are synthesized from session context, commit history, onboarding logs, and explicit user feedback.
- Each lesson includes rationale, process update, and implementation details.
- Protocol changes are tracked for onboarding and future reference.

---

## Next Steps

- Continuously update this file as new lessons emerge.
- Use lessons to refine autonomous, onboarding, and collaboration protocols.
