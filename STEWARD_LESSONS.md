## Stewardship Lessons Log

### 2025-09-01

**Lesson:**  
If a type of process fails, verify whether the active role + expertise are truly optimal for that process.  
If not, switch to the more appropriate role/expertise before continuing remediation or diagnosis.

**Rationale:**  
Repeated CI workflow failures highlighted the importance of matching role/expertise to the type of process. Autonomous protocols must adapt responsibilities accordingly for effective troubleshooting.
