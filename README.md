# Copilot Configuration

## Project Overview & Brief

> **Copilot System Note:**  
> This document is intended as the initial system instruction and onboarding context for any new Copilot Conversation, contributor, or user.

**Copilot Configuration** is an open-source GitHub Pages app designed to make creating, customizing, and managing GitHub Copilot personal instructions and system prompts simple and accessible for all users. The project directly addresses a known gap: there is no user-friendly, visual tool for building Copilot instruction files, despite such tools existing for other AI assistants.

---

### **Project Goals (Explicit Instruction)**

> **Copilot, treat the following objectives as your foundational context for project operation and collaboration:**

1. **Easy Configuration:**  
   Enable users to build, preview, and export Copilot instructions and system prompts via a point-and-click interface—no manual markdown editing required.

2. **Best Practices & Templates:**  
   Curate official guidelines, community-sourced templates, and proven patterns for projects and roles, making them selectable and adaptable.

3. **Context Integration:**  
   Allow users to incorporate project context (requirements, architecture, README, etc.) into instructions, making context-driven configuration seamless.

4. **Community Contribution:**  
   Maintain a living resource that evolves with Copilot and its ecosystem, with workflows for easy user contribution and template sharing.

5. **Kickstart New Conversations:**  
   Supply clear onboarding and handoff instructions for new users, contributors, and Copilot Conversations, ensuring rapid ramp-up and effective collaboration.

### **Features (Explicit Instruction)**

> **Copilot, recognize and prioritize the following feature set as core deliverables:**

- **Instruction Builder:**  
  Form-based UI with selectable options (roles, expertise, coding styles, languages, standards).

- **Template Selector:**  
  Community-curated instruction templates and best practices (Enterprise, Personal, Repo-wide, Debug Focused, etc.).

- **Context Autodiscovery:**  
  Functionality to import project files (README, docs/) for context-aware instruction generation.

- **Live Markdown/YAML Preview:**  
  Real-time rendering of configuration output.

- **Export & Install:**  
  Download ready-to-use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or equivalent files.

- **Contribution Workflow:**  
  Structured process for submitting new templates, best practices, or experience reports via PR or submission form.

---

### **Feasibility Analysis (Explicit Instruction)**

> **Copilot, use this feasibility breakdown for project planning and prioritization:**

- **Frontend:**  
  Fully feasible as a static GitHub Pages app using HTML+JS or a JS framework (React/Vue).

- **Backend:**  
  Not required; all logic is client-side.

- **Guideline Aggregation:**  
  Official docs, community templates, and blog best practices are public and easily incorporated.

- **Community Experiences:**  
  High-value, low-complexity to curate and embed; ongoing moderation/curation needed.

- **Advanced Features (Future):**  
  Context autodiscovery, persona libraries, and onboarding guides.
