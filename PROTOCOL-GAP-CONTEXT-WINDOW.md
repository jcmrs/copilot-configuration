# Protocol Gap: Context Window, Token Use, and Autonomous State Validation

## Problem Statement

Copilot (and current LLM-based agents) **cannot directly inspect, measure, or validate** session state, token usage, or context window status in real time.  
This means:
- Autonomous protocol execution may silently degrade if session history is truncated due to context window overflow or message buffer limits.
- Critical instructions, role activations, or rationale for decisions may be lost or omitted without warning.
- The agent cannot detect or log these failures except by external symptoms (inconsistent output, forgotten context, etc.).

## Evidence

- No system variable or API is exposed for token count or context window status.
- No autonomous self-test can guarantee protocol adherence in long or complex sessions.

## Recommendation

- Document this gap in onboarding and project management files.
- Periodically restate session context and personal instructions to mitigate context loss.
- Request re-provisioning of protocols/instructions if context loss is suspected.
- Escalate to human maintainers for ambiguous or high-impact changes if context reliability is uncertain.
